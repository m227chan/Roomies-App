Roomies Application Description:

The application includes three main features: expense tracker, grocery list, and calendar. The expense tracker will track shared expenses and simplify the payment process down to a single transaction. The grocery feature will allow users to create a single, combined grocery list with their roommates to minimize trips to the store. The calendar feature will allow users to coordinate their schedules, periods of quiet hours, and communicate about shared responsibilities like chores.
